What the material world values does
not shine the same in the truth of

the soul.  You have been interested
in your shadow.  Look instead directly

at the sun.  What can we know by just
watching the time-and-space shapes of

each other?  Someone half awake in the night sees imaginary dangers; the

morning star rises; the horizon grows
defined; people become friends in a

moving caravan.  Night birds may think
daybreak a kind of darkness, because

that's all they know.  It's a fortunate
bird who's not intrigued with evening,

who flies in the sun we call Shams.
